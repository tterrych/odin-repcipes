    </p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ onion (4 oz, 113 g)</li>
        <li>1 green onions/scallions</li>
        <li>½ lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) (you can also slice your own meat)</li>
    
    <h3><u>For the Sauce</u></h3>
    
        <li>½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock) (use standard Awase Dashi, dashi packet or powder, or Vegan Dashi)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp sake (substitute with dry sherry or Chinese rice wine, or use water for a non-alcohol version)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mirin (or use 2 Tbsp sake/water + 2 tsp sugar)</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sugar (to taste)</li>
    
    <h3><u>For Serving</u></h3>
    
        <li>2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        <li>pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga) (to garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps.</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, thinly slice ½ onion.
        <li>Next, cut 1 green onions/scallions diagonally into thin slices. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Then, take out ½ lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) from the freezer. Cut the semi-frozen sliced meat into pieces 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan (do not turn on the heat yet), add ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp mirin, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp sugar. Mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Next, add the onion slices and spread them throughout the pan, separating the onion layers.</li>
        <li>Then, add the meat on top of the onions. Separate the thin slices of beef so the meat covers the onions.</li>
    <h3><u>To Cook</u></h3>
        <li>Cover the pan with a lid. Now, turn on the heat to medium and start cooking.</li>
        <li>When the meat has browned, skim off the scum and fat from the broth with a fine-mesh skimmer. Turn down the heat to a simmer and continue cooking, covered, for 3–4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the green onions on top and cook covered for another minute. Optional: If you would like to add beaten eggs, you can do it now.</li>
    <h3><u>To Serve</u></h3>
        <li>Divide 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice into large donburi bowls. Then, drizzle some of the pan sauce on top of the rice.</li>
        <li>Put the beef and onion mixture on top of the rice. If you’d like, drizzle additional remaining sauce on top. Top the Gyudon with pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga).</li> 
    </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
